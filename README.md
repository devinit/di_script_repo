# DI Script Repository
Collection of useful DI scripts for use by analysts.

Any analyst can add their own scripts to the repository. Ideally scripts should be as compatible as possible (i.e. without requiring changes to working directory).

To help others who might want to use your work, insert this standard template at the top of your script:

```
#Description:
#Author:
#Creation date:
#Last revision:
#Notes:
```
